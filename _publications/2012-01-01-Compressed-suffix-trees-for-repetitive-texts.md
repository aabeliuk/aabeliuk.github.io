excerpt: 'We design a new compressed suffix tree specifically tailored to highly repetitive text collections. This is particularly useful for sequence analysis on large collections of genomes of the close species. We build on an existing compressed suffix tree that applies statistical compression, and modify it so that it works on the grammar-compressed version of the longest common prefix array, whose differential version inherits much of the repetitiveness of the text. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.'
