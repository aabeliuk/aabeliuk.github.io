  Hi! I am a Research Scientist at the USC [Information Sciences Institute](https://minds.isi.edu/). My research focuses on understanding the impact of algorithms in society and designing social computing systems by applying behavioral modeling, optimization, game theory, and online experiments to harness collective behavior towards more efficient social outcomes.  


  Before I was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT Media Lab, Boston as a member of the [Scalable Cooperation Group](http://scalable.media.mit.edu/), lead by Prof. [Iyad Rahwan](https://rahwan.me/). There I studied theory of algorithms and complexity, and its applications to online dating markets, AI and ethics.
			
  In 2017, I received my Ph.D from the University of Melbourne under the supervision of two great teachers that shaped my research interests: [Pascal Van Hentenryck](http://pwp.gatech.edu/pascal-van-hentenryck/) and [Gerardo Berbeglia](http://gerardo.berbeglia.com/). Together we worked in the analysis of behavioral models for choice under social influence in cultural markets. We have tackled the problem from a complexity, dynamic evolution and experimental perspective. My thesis was on the optimality and predictability of online markets with social influence.
			

  In 2012, I got the degree of Civil Engineer in Computer Science from the [University of Chile](http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/), under the supervision of [Gonzalo Navarro](https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/). During that time, we worked together in compressed data structures tailored for pattern matching in Bioinformatics applications.
